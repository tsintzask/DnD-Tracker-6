# DnD-Tracker-6
I don't actually know if I'll ever complete this or even start it, but making a repository for it will probably motivate me a bit.

First off, hi, I'm Tsintzask, a freshman Computer Science student who also DMs for a group of friends.
My intention with this is to create my own way to track each character's stats and equipment.
Basically I envision this as a rather basic "input each character's stuff, store it in a file" type deal.
I could, of course, eventually add to it, but that remains to be seen.
